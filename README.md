Customizer Definitely
=====================

This framework plugin makes adding customizer panels, sections and fields to WordPress very simple, yet flexible. It all works using a single action and an array.

You can download the latest version from the [WordPress plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-definitely/). If you prefer to install it from Github, make sure to run `composer install` before using it in order to download the necessary dependencies.

For a detailed guide and reference on how to use this framework, please read the [Wiki on Github](https://github.com/felixarntz/customizer-definitely/wiki). Once you get familiar with the options you have, you will be able to create complex customizer interfaces with panels, sections and fields in just a few minutes.
